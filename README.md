# Second-Portfolio-Project-DataVisualization-App

## About the app ðŸ‘Ž
##### It is data visualization app where you can perform EDA(identifying missing pattern and exploring dataset) as well as Visulization on your dataset you need to only upload dataset and press the key In just a few minutes you will get your results.
 
## Objective :-
#### Purpose of this project is to perform EDA(identifying missing pattern and exploring dataset) and Visualization on datset as you can find Null values,Duplicates Values, Mean,median,mode,standarddeviation ,variance from dataset as well as you can perform visualization on dataset to detect outliers using BoxPlot, to see correlation using Heatmap,to see data distribution using Histogram,to explore null values in dataset using Heatmap so these all can be performed by Web-app you need to only upload your dataset and select the options that you want and your will be done it will direct give you result from exploring dataset. 

### Tools used :-
###### Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Streamlit, Pycharm.

## Deployment :-I Deployed my app on Streamlit,it is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps, In just a few minutes you can build and deploy powerful data apps.
